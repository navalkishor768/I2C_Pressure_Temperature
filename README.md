# I2C_Pressure_Temperature
This project include works on using I2C communication for reading sensor BMP180 for Temperature and Pressure.

Here I have used Temperature and Pressure sensor from Bosch i.e. BMP180.

Using I2C I have read and displayed temperature and pressure on terminal and LCD 16x2.

Mathematic Calculation reference is taken from Datasheet of BMP180 and internet references.

Following is the Proteus Simulation schematic and video demo.
